# Kaleidoscope
"Kaleidoscope" is an interactive installation that uses light and RGB sensor input through Arduino to create unique, kaleidoscope-like patterns based in Processing. The viewer takes a laser pointer and points it at the sensors, resulting in moving shapes with varying colors. Shape size is based on brightness input through a photocell, while the colors are affected by the RGB sensor's input. In addition, there is a button for the viewer to switch between the two types of patterns: circular and geometric. Overall, the project is an exploratory and interactive playground of colors and shapes.
